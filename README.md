<h1 align="center">Make your meetings accessible to AI Agents 🤖</h1>

**joinly.ai** is a connector middleware designed to enable AI agents to join and actively participate in video calls. Through its MCP server, joinly.ai provides essential [meeting tools](#tools) and [resources](#resources) that can equip any AI agent with the skills to perform tasks and interact with you in real time during your meetings.

# :zap: Quickstart
Run joinly via Docker with a basic conversational agent client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites**: [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joinly-ai/joinly
cd joinly
```

Create a new `.env` file in the project root with your API keys. See [.env.example](.env.example) for complete configuration options including Anthropic (Claude) and Ollama setups. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and adjust the model name as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember not to copy the [.env.example](.env.example) exactly. Instead, delete the placeholder values of the providers you don't use.

```Dotenv
# .env
# for OpenAI LLM
# change key and model to your desired one
JOINLY_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
JOINLY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```
> [!TIP]
> You can find the OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

Pull the Docker image (~2.3GB since it packages browser and models):
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest
```

Launch your meeting in [Zoom](https://www.zoom.com), [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com) or Teams and let joinly join the meeting using the meeting link as `<MeetingURL>`:
```bash  
docker run --env-file .env ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest -v --client <MeetingURL>
```
> :red_circle: Having trouble getting started? Let's figure it out together on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/AN5NEBkS4d)! 

# :technologist: Run an external client
In Quickstart, we ran the Docker Container directly as a client using `--client`. But we can also run it as a server and connect to it from outside the container, which allows us to control the entire logic of our agent. Here, we run an external client implementation and connect it to the joinly MCP server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites**: do the [Quickstart](#zap-quickstart) (except the last command), [install uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), and open two terminals

Start the joinly server in the first terminal (note, we are not using `--client` here and forward port `8000`):
```bash  
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest -v
```

While the server is running, start the example client implementation in the second terminal window to connect to it and join a meeting:
```bash  
uv run examples/client_example.py --mcp-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/ <MeetingUrl>
```

## Add MCP servers to the client
Add the tools of any MCP server to the example client by providing a JSON configuration. In [config_tavily.json](examples/config_tavily.json), we add the Tavily MCP server for web search functionality (requires `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env`):

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "tavily": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp@0.2.2"]
        }
    }
}
```

You can also add multiple entries under `"mcpServers"` which will all be available as tools in the meeting (see [fastmcp client docs](https://gofastmcp.com/clients/client) for config syntax). Then, run the client using the config file (`--config <file>`):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the joinly server is running in the other terminal

```bash  
uv run examples/client_example.py --mcp-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/ --config examples/config_tavily.json <MeetingUrl>
```

# :wrench: Configurations

Configurations can be given via env variables and/or command line args. Here is a list of common configuration options, which can be used when starting the docker container:
```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest <MyOptionArgs>
```

## Basic Settings

In general, the docker image provides an MCP server which is started by default. But to quickly get started, we also include a client implementation that can be used via `--client`. Note, in this case no server is started and no other client can connect to it.

```bash
# Start directly as client; default is as server, to which an external client can connect
--client <MeetingUrl>

# Change participant name (default: joinly)
--name "AI Assistant"

# Change language of TTS/STT (default: en)
# Note, availability depends on the TTS/STT provider
--lang de

# Change host & port of the joinly MCP server
--host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Providers

### Text-to-Speech
```bash
# Kokoro (local) TTS (default)
--tts kokoro
--tts-arg voice=<VoiceName>  # optionally, set different voice

# ElevenLabs TTS, include ELEVENLABS_API_KEY in .env
--tts elevenlabs
--tts-arg voice_id=<VoiceID>  # optionally, set different voice

# Deepgram TTS, include DEEPGRAM_API_KEY in .env
--tts deepgram
--tts-arg model_name=<ModelName>  # optionally, set different model (voice)
```

### Transcription
```bash
# Whisper (local) STT (default)
--stt whisper
--stt-arg model_name=<ModelName>  # optionally, set different model (default: base), for GPU support see below

# Deepgram STT, include DEEPGRAM_API_KEY in .env
--stt deepgram
--stt-arg model_name=<ModelName>  # optionally, set different model
```

## Debugging
```bash
# Start browser with a VNC server for debugging;
# forward the port and connect to it using a VNC client
--vnc-server --vnc-server-port 5900

# Logging
-v  # or -vv, -vvv

# Help
--help
```

## GPU Support

We provide a Docker image with CUDA GPU support for running the transcription and TTS models on a GPU. To use it, you need to have the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) installed and `CUDA >= 12.6`. Then pull the CUDA-enabled image:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest-cuda
```

Run as client or server with the same commands as above, but use the `joinly:{version}-cuda` image and set `--gpus all`:
```bash
# Run as server
docker run --gpus all --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest-cuda -v
# Run as client
docker run --gpus all --env-file .env ghcr.io/joinly-ai/joinly:latest-cuda -v --client <MeetingURL>
```

By default, the `joinly` image uses the Whisper model `base` for transcription, since it still runs reasonably fast on CPU. For `cuda`, it automatically defaults to `distil-large-v3` for significantly better transcription quality. You can change the model by setting `--stt-arg model_name=<model_name>` (e.g., `--stt-arg model_name=large-v3`). However, only the respective default models are packaged in the docker image, so it will start to download the model weights on container start.

# :test_tube: Create your own client

You can also write your own client from scratch and connect it to our joinly MCP server. See [client_example.py](examples/client_example.py) for a starting point.

The joinly MCP server provides following tools and resources:

### Tools

- **`join_meeting`** - Join meeting with URL, participant name, and optional passcode
- **`leave_meeting`** - Leave the current meeting
- **`speak_text`** - Speak text using TTS (requires `text` parameter)
- **`send_chat_message`** - Send chat message (requires `message` parameter)
- **`mute_yourself`** - Mute microphone
- **`unmute_yourself`** - Unmute microphone
- **`get_chat_history`** - Get current meeting chat history in JSON format
- **`get_participants`** - Get current meeting participants in JSON format
- **`get_transcript`** - Get current meeting transcript in JSON format, optionally filtered by minutes
- *more soon...*

### Resources

- `transcript://live` - Live meeting transcript in JSON format, including timestamps and speaker information. Subscribable for real-time updates when new utterances are added.

# :building_construction: Developing joinly.ai

For development we recommend using the development container, which installs all necessary dependencies. To get started, install the DevContainer Extension for Visual Studio Code, open the repository and choose **Reopen in Container**.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joinly-ai/assets/main/images/others/reopen_in_container.png" width="500" alt="Reopen in Devcontainer">

The installation can take some time, since it downloads all packages as well as models for Whisper/Kokoro and the Chromium browser. At the end, it automatically invokes the [download_assets.py](scripts/download_assets.py) script. If you see errors like `Missing kokoro-v1.0.onnx`, run this script manually using:
```bash
uv run scripts/download_assets.py
```

We'd love to see what you are using it for or building with it. Showcase your work on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/AN5NEBkS4d)
